Given a N x N matrix. Write a program to find count of all the distinct elements common to all rows of the matrix. Print count of such elements.

Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains a single integer N which denotes the dimension of matrix. Second line of each test case contains N*N space separated integers which denotes elements of the matrix.

Output:
For each test case, print count of all the distinct elements common to all rows of the matrix.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000

Example:
Input:
