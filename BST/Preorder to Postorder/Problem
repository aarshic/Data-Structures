Given an array arr[] of N nodes representing preorder traversal of BST. The task is to print its postorder traversal.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is N, the size of array. The second line of each test case contains N input as arr[i].

Output:
Postorder traversal of the given preorder traversal is printed.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= arr[i] <= 104

Example:
Input:
3
5
40 30 35 80 100
8
40 30 32 35 80 90 100 120

Output:
35 30 100 80 40
35 32 30 120 100 90 80 40
