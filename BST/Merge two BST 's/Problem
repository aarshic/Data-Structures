	Given two BST, you need to print the elements of both BSTs in sorted form.

Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains three lines. The first line of each test case contain's an integer N and M denoting the size of the two BST's. Then In the next two line are space separated values of the two BST's.

Output Format:
For each testcase, in a new line, print the elements of both BSTs in sorted form.

Your Task:
This is a function problem, you don't have to take any input. Just complete the function merge() that nodes of both BSTs as parameters.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N,M <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
3 3
1 33 4 
6 7 1
2 2
1 6
9 2

Output:
1 1 4 6 7 33
1 2 6 9

Explanation:
Testcase1: The BSTs look like

BST1:
                1
                  \
                    4
                       \
                         33

BST2:
                     6
                    /   \
                   1    7
The sorted elements of above BSTs are 1 1 4 6 7 33
