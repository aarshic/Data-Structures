Given an array of length n + 1, containing elements 1 through n and a space, Requires the use of a given swap (index i, index j) function to sort the array, You can only swap the gap and a number, in the end, put the gap at the end.
There will be a number 999 in array as gap or space.
Examples:

Input  : arr = {1, 5, 4, 999, 3, 2}
Output : arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 999}
We need to sort only by moving 

Input  : arr = {1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8, 7, 999, 6}
Output : arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 999}
