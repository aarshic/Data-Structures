Given a doubly linked list, a position p and an integer x. The task  is to add a new node with value x at position just after pth node in the doubly linked list.

Input:
First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, first line of input contains number of nodes in the linked list, and next line contains two integers p and x.

Output:
For each testcase, there will be a single line of output which prints the modified linked list.

User Task:
The task is to complete the function addNode() which head reference, position and data to be inserted as the arguments, with no return type.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
1 <= N <= 103
0 <= p < N

Example:
Input:
2
3
2 4 5
2 6
4
1 2 3 4
0 44

Output:
2 4 5 6
1 44 2 3 4

Explanation:
Testcase 1: p = 2, and x = 6. So, 6 is inserted after p, i.e, at position 3 (0-based indexing).
