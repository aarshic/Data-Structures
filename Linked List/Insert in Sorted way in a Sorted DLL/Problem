Example:
Initial doubly linked list:


Doubly Linked List after insertion of 9:


Input:
The function takes two arguments as input, reference pointer to the head of the doubly linked list and an element X.
There will be T test cases and for each test case the function will be called separately.

Output:
For each test print the space separated vales of the doubly linked list.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
0<=N<=1000

Example:
Input:
2
5
1 9 16 25 78
2
3
1 2 3
5
Output:
