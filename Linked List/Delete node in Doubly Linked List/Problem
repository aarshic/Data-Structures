Delete a node from given position in a doubly linked list.

Input:

In this problem, method takes two argument: the address of the head of the linked list and the node you have to delete . The function should not read any input from stdin/console.
The Node structure has a data part which stores the data and a next pointer which points to the next element of the linked list. 
There are multiple test cases. For each test case, this method will be called individually.

Output:

Delete the node from the given doubly linked list and set *head_ref if required .

Constraints:
1<=T<=300
2<=N<=100
1<=x<=N

Example:

Input:
2
3                        //Size of Linked List
1  3 4                 //Elements of Linked List
3                        //Location of element to be deleted
4
1 5 2 9                    
1

Output:
1 3           
5 2 9
