Given two strings A and B, find if A is a subsequence of B.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated strings A and B.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line, print 1 if a is sub-sequences of b else print 0.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 900
1<= |A|,|B| <=104

Example:
Input:
2
AXY YADXCP
gksrek geeksforgeeks

Output:
0
1

Explanation:
Testcase1: 
Input: A = "axy", B = "yadxcp"
Output: 0 (A is not a subsequence of B)
Testcase2:
Input: A = "gksrek", B = "geeksforgeeks"
Output: 1 (str1 is a subsequence of str2)
