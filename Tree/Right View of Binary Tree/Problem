Given a Binary Tree, print Right view of it. Right view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when tree is viewed from right side.

Right view of following tree is 1 3 7 8.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /   \      /    \
  4     5   6    7
    \
     8

Input Format:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line contains number of edges. The second line contains relation between nodes.

Output Format:
For each test case, in a new line, print right view of the binary tree.

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't have to take input. Just complete the function rightView() that takes node as parameter.

Constraints:
1 <=T<= 100
1 <= Number of nodes<= 100
1 <= Data of a node<= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
2
1 2 R 1 3 L
4
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R

Output:
1 2
10 30 60

Explanation:
Test case 1:

           1

        /     \

      3        2

For the above test case the right view is: 1 2

Test case 2:

            10

         /        \

     20          30

   /      \      

40      60

Right View is: 10 30 60.
