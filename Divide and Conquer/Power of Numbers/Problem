Given a number N, let the reverse of the number be R. The task is to print the output of the Expression pow(N,R), where pow function represents N raised to power R.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 1000000007.

Input:
The first line of the input consists of an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing an integer N.

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, print in a new line, the output of the expression pow as described above.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
0 <= N <= 1010

Example:
Input:
2
2
12

Output:
4
864354781

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The reverse of 2 is 2 and after raising power of 2 by 2 we get 4 which gives remainder as 4 by dividing 1000000007.
